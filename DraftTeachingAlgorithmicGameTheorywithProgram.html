Thus, I have a unique opportunity to organize my independent work around live student feedback, which will be incorporated into the development of later assignments.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential assignment topics include college admissions (using stable matchings), elections, and blockchain incentives. The design of the assignments and instructor solutions will be done under supervision and lead of Professor Weinberg: we will both brainstorm potential assignments, and then select for implementation the one we think best engages students. I will be primarily responsible for developing the software interfaces for students to design against, the instructor tooling for quantitative and qualitative evaluation of student submissions, and the student tooling for simulating and testing their assignments. The student tooling will allow students to test their programs in assignments which simulate the real evaluation environment. I will also be providing support to students who are completing the assignments and organizing the usage of the instructor evaluation tools. If time permits, I would like to develop an online leaderboard connected to the CS Dropbox to allow students to compare their submissions against each other in real time before the submission deadline.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c1">Evaluation</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c1">I will request feedback from current students about their overall satisfaction with the programming assignments as compared to additional theoretical problems (which are still the assignment backbone), their usage of my tools, and their general suggestions, to improve subsequent assignments. I will also request feedback from Professor Weinberg and the undergraduate graders of the course regarding how to provide better instructor-side tooling for the assignments. My success will be valuable through students&rsquo; self-perceived ability to focus on the core assignment content without experiencing undue difficulties with the assignment structure and through instructors&rsquo; present and future usage of the developed &nbsp;assignments. Qualitative measures of success include elements of survey results described above, decrease in illegal (i.e. errors unrelated to course content) programs submitted as measured by anonymized metrics such as lower-outlier rates in quantitative simulation performance of student submissions, and decrease in instructor resources (e.g. time) required to maintain and grade the assignments. These data can be compared to similar data from the two similar exercises assigned in previous years.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4 c1">Big mistake in &lsquo;present&rsquo; - bad at communicating how students would be graded</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c4 c1">In the first three weeks of the semester, I have already developed, implemented, and deployed two assignments, and have developed all of the tools necessary for grading submissions.

This document was in the General Resources section of the Piazza resources page, referred to from the programming assignment description for both problem sets (although the reference was confusing). Survey results indicate that we didn&#39;t properly advertise it and most students were not aware of its existence. Thus, a lot of students were surprised that the objective questions and the strength of the writeup were the dominant factors in their grades --- not the performance of their software. Given that we did a poor job making this clear, we&#39;ll be altering how these two assignments are included in your final grade. See @394 for details.</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c4 c1">What is the role of programming in a theory course?</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c4 c1">Survey results indicate at least a few students are confused why they need to program in a theory course. One key difference between COS 445 (being a theoretical computer science course on game theory) and ECO 418, MAT 378, or POL 347 (other game theory courses offered at Princeton) is that we place some emphasis on the connections between game-theoretic results and algorithms, software, and other aspects of computer science. One way in which we do this is by asking students to connect their learning in this course to their learning in prerequisite courses, in this case COS 226. Past course feedback was overwhelmingly positive for programming challenges (so the hope is that the initial negative feedback this cycle is due more to poor administration)</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c4 c1">Here&#39;s what we didn&#39;t make clear: the &quot;programming assignments&quot; aren&#39;t really about your ability to code. They are about placing the theoretical results from the course in context. They create a scenario in which mastery of theoretical results from the course content is demonstrated by making and justifying real-world decisions. However (and we didn&#39;t communicate this well), we are still grading your response to the programming exercises as a theory problem. That is why 2/3 of the credit on the &quot;programming exercises&quot; goes to the theoretical questions, and why poor performance of your software strategy (so long as it does not crash) can be entirely offset by a well-written writeup. So, in actuality, 0% of your grade is solely dependent on your programming ability --- as is appropriate in a theory course! We include the empirical performance of your strategy in a way that can only benefit your grade in the course, to reward students who demonstrated mastery of the course content by designing a great strategy even if they did not describe it perfectly</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c4 c1">Why do we have to use Java (not Python)?</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c4 c1">We would love to do these assignments in Python, as many students requested, but unfortunately we do not have Python experience as a course prerequisite and are firmly of the conviction that it is inappropriate for a course to expect students to learn a programming language they have never seen before with no formal instruction (no matter how many other courses do that).</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c4 c1">Additionally, empirical data from other course surveys suggests that 90% of students report themselves fluent in Java after the Princeton introductory sequence, compared to 30% for python.</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c4 c1">Why are my strategies graded against instructor strategies instead of against the strategies of my peers?</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c4 c1">We do not believe it is right to grade students against their peers&#39; submissions because academic performance should not be a zero-sum game. This was overwhelmingly requested by last year&#39;s class.</span></p><hr class="c14"><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt1">[1]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/Teaching/cos445sp17.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1522867200381000">https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/Teaching/cos445sp17.htm</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref2" id="ftnt2">[2]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.princetoncourses.com/course/1174012095&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1522867200381000">https://www.princetoncourses.com/course/1174012095</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref3" id="ftnt3">[3]</a><span class="c13 c2">&nbsp;Ibid.</span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref4" id="ftnt4">[4]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://beta.blogs.harvard.edu/k108875/assignments/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1522867200386000">https://beta.blogs.harvard.edu/k108875/assignments/</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref5" id="ftnt5">[5]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/364a.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1522867200382000">https://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/364a.html</a></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/f16/f16.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1522867200382000">https://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/f16/f16.html</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref6" id="ftnt6">[6]</a><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6840/2014sp/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1522867200383000">https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6840/2014sp/</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref7" id="ftnt7">[7]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse522/05sp/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1522867200383000">https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse522/05sp/</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref8" id="ftnt8">[8]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs455/fall11/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1522867200384000">https://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs455/fall11/</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref9" id="ftnt9">[9]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/courses/agtS15.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1522867200384000">https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/courses/agtS15.html</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref10" id="ftnt10">[10]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c10"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002121909/http://www.cc.gatech.edu/%257Eninamf/LGO10/index.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1522867200384000">https://web.archive.org/web/20131002121909/http://www.cc.gatech.edu/%7Eninamf/LGO10/index.html</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref11" id="ftnt11">[11]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~arielpro/15896s16/index.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1522867200385000">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~arielpro/15896s16/index.html</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref12" id="ftnt12">[12]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring16/compsci590.4/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1522867200385000">https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring16/compsci590.4/</a></span></p></div></body></html>
